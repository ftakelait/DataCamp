They are similar to bags of words, just with numbers. You use them to count how many tokens there are.
Word vectors are sparse arrays representing bigrams in the corpora. You can use them to compare two sets of words to one another.
Word vectors are multi-dimensional mathematical representations of words created using deep learning methods. They give us insight into relationships between words in a corpus.
Word vectors don't actually help NLP and are just hype.
