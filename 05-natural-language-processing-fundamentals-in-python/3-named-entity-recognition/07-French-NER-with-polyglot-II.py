Use a list comprehension to create a list of tuples called entities.
The output expression of your list comprehension should be a tuple. Remember to use () to create the tuple.
The first element of each tuple is the entity tag, which you can access using its .tag attribute.
The second element is the full string of the entity text, which you can access using ' '.join(ent).
Your iterator variable should be ent, and you should iterate over all of the entities of the polyglot Text object, txt.
Print entities to see what you've created.

# Create the list of tuples: entities
entities = [(ent.tag, ' '.join(ent)) for ent in txt.entities]

# Print the entities
print(entities)
