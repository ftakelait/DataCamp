Spanish NER with polyglot

You'll continue your exploration of polyglot now with some Spanish annotation. This article is not written by a newspaper, so it is your first example of a more blog-like text. How do you think that might compare when finding entities?

The Text object has been created as txt, and each entity has been printed, as you can see in the IPython Shell.

Your specific task is to determine how many of the entities contain the words "Márquez" or "Gabo" - these refer to the same person in different ways!

Iterate over all of the entities of txt, using ent as your iterator variable.
Check whether the entity contains "Márquez" or "Gabo". If it does, increment count.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see what percentage of entities refer to Gabriel García Márquez (aka Gabo).

# Initialize the count variable: count
count = 0

# Iterate over all the entities
for ent in txt.entities:
    # Check whether the entity contains 'Márquez' or 'Gabo'
    if 'Márquez' in ent or 'Gabo' in ent:
        # Increment count
        count += 1

# Print count
print(count)

# Calculate the percentage of entities that refer to "Gabo": percentage
percentage = count * 1.0 / len(txt.entities)
print(percentage)
