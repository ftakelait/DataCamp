This chapter will introduce a slightly more advanced topic - Named-entity recognition. You'll learn how to identify the who, what and where of your texts using pre-trained models on English and non-English text. You'll also learn how to use some new libraries - polyglot and spaCy - to add to your NLP toolbox.
