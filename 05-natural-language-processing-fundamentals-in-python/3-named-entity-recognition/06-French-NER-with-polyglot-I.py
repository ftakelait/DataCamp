"""
French NER with polyglot I

In this exercise and the next, you'll use the polyglot library to identify French entities. The library functions slightly differently than spacy, so you'll use a few of the new things you learned in the last video to display the named entity text and category.

You have access to the full article string in article. Additionally, the Text class of polyglot has been imported from polyglot.text.
